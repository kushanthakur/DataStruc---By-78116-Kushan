/* 2. Given a list of N elements, which follows no particular arrangement, you are required to search an
element x in the list. The list is stored using array data structure. If the search is successful, the output
should be the index at which the element occurs, otherwise returns -1 to indicate that the element is
not present in the list. Assume that the elements of the list are all distinct. Write a program to perform
the desired task.
